    // FAQ
    "faq.badge": "❓ FAQ",
    "faq.title": "FREQUENTLY ASKED",
    "faq.subtitle": "Everything you need to know about SOUR and the Starter Culture movement.",
    "faq.q1": "What is SOUR?",
    "faq.a1": "SOUR is a protocol that turns communities into economies. Inspired by 10,000-year-old sourdough starter — the original decentralized technology — SOUR builds the infrastructure for people to produce, trade, and grow without middlemen. Your dough, your bread, your economy.",
    "faq.q2": "What does 'Digital Feudalism' mean?",
    "faq.a2": "Today, platforms harvest the value you create. YouTube takes 45%, Upwork takes 20%, banks inflate your savings away. You produce, they profit. SOUR reverses this — the protocol is owned by its users, and all value flows back to the Bakers.",
    "faq.q3": "Is this a memecoin?",
    "faq.a3": "SOUR has the soul of a movement and the humor of a meme. Yes, there are memes — the starter mascot is adorable. But there's a real protocol being built: identity, agreements, payments, and governance. The memes get you in the door; the civilization keeps you.",
    "faq.q4": "What makes SOUR different?",
    "faq.a4": "Three things: (1) The Crust — your reputation is yours forever, on-chain, portable. (2) The Handshake — trade with anyone, anywhere, with code as your guarantee. (3) The Harvest — 50% of all fees buy back $SOUR and deepen protocol-owned liquidity, 30% go to Keepers. You earn by holding.",
    "faq.q5": "How do I buy $SOUR?",
    "faq.a5": "SOUR is available on Pump.fun (Solana). Connect your Phantom or Solflare wallet, swap SOL for SOUR, and you're a Baker. As the protocol grows, SOUR will be available on multiple chains — every Oven, every Flame.",
    "faq.q6": "What are Keeper Tiers?",
    "faq.a6": "The longer you hold without selling, the higher your tier. Fresh Dough (Day 1) → Rising Dough (30 days) → Golden Crust (90 days) → Eternal Starter (365 days). Higher tiers earn more from the Harvest and get stronger governance power. Sell and your tier resets.",
    "faq.q7": "Who runs SOUR?",
    "faq.a7": "The Bakers. There is no CEO, no board, no headquarters. The code is open source, the liquidity is protocol-owned, the mint is revoked. The protocol is moving toward full DAO governance. Don't trust us — verify on-chain.",
    "faq.q8": "What's the tokenomics?",
    "faq.a8": "1 Billion $SOUR. 100% to community. No team allocation. 0% buy/sell tax. Protocol-owned LP. Mint revoked. Freeze revoked. Protocol fees: 50% buyback + LP, 30% to Keepers, 20% to Commons. This is as fair as it gets.",
    "faq.q9": "What is the Bake Plan?",
    "faq.a9": "First Rise (Now): Token launch + community building. The Recipe (Next): Protocol smart contracts + first buybacks + first Harvests. Every Oven (Future): Multichain + no-code platform builder + DAO governance + the Civilization rises.",
    "faq.q10": "How can I contribute?",
    "faq.a10": "Hold $SOUR and become a Keeper. Create memes with the Sour mascot. Join the Telegram Bakery. Spread the word. When the protocol launches, build your own Bakery. Every Baker matters.",
    "faq.q11": "What is The Handshake?",
    "faq.a11": "The Handshake is a trustless P2P escrow protocol on Solana. Two wallets agree on deliverables, deadline, and payment. $SOUR is locked in a smart contract vault — released when the creator approves the work. A 2% Pinch fee feeds the ecosystem: 50% burn, 30% Keepers, 20% Commons. Currently live on devnet.",
    "faq.q12": "Is this open source?",
    "faq.a12": "Yes. The entire codebase — website, smart contracts, SDK — is public on GitHub. The protocol is built in the open. Don't trust us, verify the code. github.com/SourDaoxyx",
